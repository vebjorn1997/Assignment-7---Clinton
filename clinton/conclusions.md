## Assumptions
Due to the BLS data only being given for each month and not the exact date,
                    I will assume that each president took office on the first day of the month.
                   This assumption lines up pretty well with the claims of Clinton even though there might be some discrepancies.

 ## Conclusion
 Based on my own analysis and assumptions of the data, I can with some confidence say that Clinton's claim is correct. Based on the data there were 66 million jobs created during this timeperiod, and the split between Democrats and Republicans matches the claims made by Clinton. That being said, there are some uncertaies as to what clinton meant by the word "produced" in his speech. There are other external factors that has skewed the data to favour the Demoracts, such as the several economic crises that happened during the Republican presidencies. Other factors include the exculsion of government jobs and farm jobs, although the government jobs would most likely have favour the Democrats over the Republicans. Other questions includes questions of wether or not a president should be creditet with jobs created a month into the office. Either way, did he lie or skew that data to favour his side is not for me to say, (I'm not political scientist) but the data he quote supports his claim.
